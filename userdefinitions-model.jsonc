// A user definitions file is a JSONC file containing pairs of keys and values
// listing what you type after the Compose key and what Compose types in response.

// Each pair except the last must be followed by a comma.

// Two forward slashes begin a comment: Compose for Notepad++ ignores
// the slashes and everything after them on the same line.

// You can use the standard escapes \n (new line), \r (return), \t (tab),
// \" (quote within a quoted string) and \\ (backslash within a quoted string).

// You can also use Unicode escapes, \u followed by four hexadecimal digits,
// for example: "\u20ac" for "â‚¬", the Euro sign. Escape sequences for characters
// outside the basic multilingual plane (code points 0x10000 or greater)
// can only be entered as a UTF-16 surrogate pair.

// You should save this file with a .jsonc extension.
// Compose for Notepad++ reads the file each time you launch Notepad++,
// so be sure to save it in a place where it won't be disturbed.
